Furry Flashbacks Game Rules:

1. Start by picking your favorite cat (Koffee or Latte) from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on a card to flip it and then click another card, trying to find matching images.
3. If both cards show the same images, they stay face-up, and you add one to your move count.
4. But if both cards do not match, they flip back down, and your move count goes up too.
5. Keep at it until you've uncovered all the pairs -- it's all about matching those images!
6. Be mindful, though! If you take more than 30 moves, the game ends, and unfortunately, you don't win.
7. The big win? Completing the game in under 30 moves â€”- showing off your skills at matching those furry flashbacks!
